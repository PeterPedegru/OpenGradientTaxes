# Cancel the Crypto Tax! 🇺🇸

An interactive, AI-driven negotiation web game powered by **OpenGradient TEE** (Trusted Execution Environment).

## The Mission
President Donald J. Trump is determined to impose a 90% tax on all cryptocurrency gains, believing "crypto people are getting too rich, too fast".

Your mission is to step into the Oval Office and convince him to drop this tax to **0%**. He is stubborn, boastful, and thinks he knows best. To win, your argument must be patriotic, brilliant, and show him how dropping the tax will make him look like a total winner.

## Features

* **Cryptographically Verified Responses**: Every response generated by the AI is securely executed and signed on-chain using OpenGradient's TEE architecture. This guarantees 100% fair play and zero server-side manipulation.
* **Progressive Hint System**: Stuck? The system will automatically offer strategic thoughts and hints to guide your negotiation tactics.
* **Modern Web Interface**: Built with raw HTML/CSS/JS using a sleek glassmorphism aesthetic and a dynamic 3D Vanta.js background.
